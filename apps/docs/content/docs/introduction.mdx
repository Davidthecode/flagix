# Welcome to Flagix Documentation

Flagix is a lightweight feature flag management platform designed to help teams safely deploy and control features. With support for gradual rollouts, A/B testing, and user targeting, Flagix enables you to ship features faster while maintaining control over your releases.

## What are Feature Flags?

Feature flags (also known as feature toggles) are a software development technique that lets you enable or disable features without deploying new code. This powerful approach gives you:

- **Instant Control**: Turn features on or off in real-time
- **Risk Mitigation**: Roll back problematic features instantly
- **Gradual Rollouts**: Release features to subsets of users
- **A/B Testing**: Test different variations with your users
- **Targeted Delivery**: Show features to specific user segments

## Why Choose Flagix?

### **Developer Friendly**
- Simple SDKs for JavaScript and React
- Minimal setup required
- TypeScript support out of the box

### **Real-time Updates**
- Changes reflect instantly in your applications

### **Advanced Targeting**
- Target specific users or segments
- Attribute-based targeting
- Percentage-based rollouts

### **Analytics & Insights**
- Track flag usage and performance
- Monitor experiment results
- Conversion tracking

### **Enterprise Ready**
- Multi-environment support
- Role-based access control
- Audit logs

## Key Concepts

### Variations

Each flag can have multiple variations that represent different values:

```javascript
// Boolean variation
const isNewUI = Flagix.evaluate("new-ui"); // true or false

// String variation
const theme = Flagix.evaluate("theme-mode"); // "light", "dark", "auto"

// Number variation
const timeoutMs = Flagix.evaluate("api-timeout"); // 5000, 10000, 30000
```

### Rules & Targeting

Rules determine which users see which variations:

- **Targeting Rules**: Serve a specific variation to users matching certain conditions
- **Experiment Rules**: Split traffic between variations for A/B testing
- **Percentage Rollouts**: Gradually release features to a percentage of users

### Environments

Manage flags separately across development, staging, and production with isolated configurations for each environment.

## Getting Started

Ready to integrate Flagix into your application?

1. **[Installation](/docs/installation)** - Set up the SDK in your project
2. **[Creating Flags](/docs/features/creating)** - Create and configure your first flag
3. **[User Targeting](/docs/targeting)** - Set up targeting rules
4. **[Analytics](/docs/analytics)** - Track usage and measure impact

## How Flagix Works

**The evaluation flow:**

1. Your application calls `Flagix.evaluate(flagKey)` with user context
2. The SDK evaluates rules locally
3. Returns the appropriate variation value
4. Automatically tracks the evaluation for analytics
5. Real-time updates push flag changes to all connected clients
6. **Reactive Updates**: When user attributes change (like a plan upgrade), the SDK notifies all components to re-evaluate instantly

This ensures evaluations are **instant, reliable, and low-latency** since they happen locally without network calls.
