title: Creating Feature Flags
description: Learn how to create and configure feature flags in Flagix
---

Feature flags are the core of Flagix. This guide walks you through creating, configuring, and managing your feature flags.

## Quick Start: Creating Your First Flag

### Step 1: Create the Flag

1. Go to your Flagix dashboard
2. Select your project
3. Click **Create Flag**
4. Enter a flag key: `new-checkout` (unique identifier, lowercase with hyphens)
5. Enter a description: "New checkout experience" (optional but recommended)
6. Click **Create**

### Step 2: Add Variations

Flagix provides two default variations (on(true) and off(false)) for every flag. For custom variations:

1. In the flag detail page, find the **Variations** section
2. Click **Add Variation**
3. Enter variation details:
   - **Name**: `new-ui` (identifier for your code)
   - **Value**: `true` (what your code receives)
   - **Type**: Select appropriate type (Boolean, String, Number)
4. Add more variations as needed
5. Click **Save Variations**

### Step 3: Configure Default Variation

The default variation is returned when no rules match. Flagix automatically selects off(false) as the default variation, to change your default variation:

1. Find the **Default Variation** section
2. Select which variation should be the default

### Step 4: Enable in Environments

By default, flags are disabled. To activate a flag:

1. Go to the **Environment Config** section
2. Select the environment (Development, Staging, Production)
3. Toggle the flag **On**
4. Click **Save**

Repeat for each environment where you want the flag active.

## Understanding Variations

Variations are the different values your flag can return. Each variation has three properties:

### Variation Types

#### Boolean Variations
Perfect for simple feature toggles:

```javascript
// In your code
const isNewFeatureEnabled = Flagix.evaluate("new-feature");

if (isNewFeatureEnabled) {
  showNewUI();
} else {
  showOldUI();
}
```

**Dashboard example:**
- Name: `enabled` | Value: `true` | Type: Boolean
- Name: `disabled` | Value: `false` | Type: Boolean

#### String Variations
For selecting between multiple string options:

```javascript
// In your code
const theme = Flagix.evaluate("ui-theme");

if (theme === "dark") {
  applyDarkTheme();
} else if (theme === "light") {
  applyLightTheme();
} else {
  applyAutoTheme();
}
```

**Dashboard example:**
- Name: `dark-mode` | Value: `"dark"` | Type: String
- Name: `light-mode` | Value: `"light"` | Type: String
- Name: `auto` | Value: `"auto"` | Type: String

#### Number Variations
For numeric configuration:

```javascript
// In your code
const timeout = Flagix.evaluate("api-timeout");
const maxRetries = Flagix.evaluate("max-retries");

fetch(url, { timeout });
```

**Dashboard example:**
- Name: `timeout-5s` | Value: `5000` | Type: Number
- Name: `timeout-10s` | Value: `10000` | Type: Number
- Name: `timeout-30s` | Value: `30000` | Type: Number

## Managing Multiple Environments

Flagix supports separate configurations across environments (e.g., Development, Staging, Production).
You can also create more environments as you wish.

### Environment Setup

1. When you create a flag, it's automatically created in the three default project environments
2. Each environment has its own configuration
3. Variations are shared across environments
4. Rules and settings can differ per environment
5. You can create additional environments in your project settings if needed

### Typical Workflow

```
Development:
  ├─ Flag enabled: YES
  ├─ Rule: Everyone sees "new-ui"
  └─ Purpose: Team testing

Staging:
  ├─ Flag enabled: YES
  ├─ Rule: 25% of users see "new-ui"
  └─ Purpose: Production preview

Production:
  ├─ Flag enabled: YES
  ├─ Rule: 50% of users see "new-ui"
  └─ Purpose: Gradual rollout
```

### Switching Environments

In the flag detail page, use the environment selector to:
- View configuration for different environments
- Edit rules per environment
- Manage variations (shared across all environments)
- Enable/disable the flag per environment

## Adding Targeting Rules

Rules determine which users see which variations. See the [Targeting Guide](/docs/targeting) for comprehensive details.

### Add a Simple Targeting Rule

1. Open your flag
2. Select the environment
3. Scroll to **Targeting Rules**
4. Click **Add Rule**
5. Enter rule details:
   - **Description**: "Premium users"
   - **Type**: Targeting
   - **Conditions**: `plan == "premium"`
   - **Rollout**: 100%
   - **Variation**: Select "new-ui"
6. Click **Save**

### Add an A/B Test

1. Open your flag
2. Scroll to **Targeting Rules**
3. Click **Add Rule**
4. Enter rule details:
   - **Description**: "50/50 A/B test"
   - **Type**: Experiment
   - **Variation A**: 50%
   - **Variation B**: 50%
5. Click **Save**

See the [Analytics Guide](/docs/analytics) to measure results.

## Rule Order & Evaluation

Rules are evaluated from top to bottom. The first matching rule determines the result.

### Reorder Rules

1. Open your flag
2. Find the **Targeting Rules** section
3. Click and drag rules to reorder them
4. Rules now evaluate in the new order

### Example Evaluation Order

```
User requests flag evaluation
  ↓
Does rule "Admin Users" match?
  → YES: Return "admin-ui"
  → NO: Continue to next rule
  ↓
Does rule "Premium Users" match?
  → YES: Return "premium-ui"
  → NO: Continue to next rule
  ↓
Does rule "Gradual Rollout" match?
  → YES: Return "new-ui" (based on rollout %)
  → NO: Continue to next rule
  ↓
No rules matched → Return default variation
```

## Editing & Managing Flags

### Edit a Flag

1. Open the flag
2. Click the **Edit** icon next to flag details
3. Update:
   - Flag key (can't change after creation)
   - Description
   - Any other settings
4. Click **Save**

### Update Variations

1. Open the flag
2. Find **Variations** section
3. Click **Edit Variations**
4. Add, remove, or rename variations
5. Click **Save**

**Note**: Changing variation values will immediately affect all users evaluating that flag.

### Delete a Rule

1. Open the flag
2. Find the rule in **Targeting Rules**
3. Click the **Delete** icon (trash can)
4. Confirm deletion

### Delete a Flag

1. Open the flag
2. Scroll to the bottom
3. Click **Delete Flag**
4. Confirm deletion

**⚠️ Warning**: Deleting a flag removes it from all environments. Make sure no code still depends on it.
