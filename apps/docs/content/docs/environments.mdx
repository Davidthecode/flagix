title: Environments & Configuration
description: Manage feature flags across development, staging, and production
---

Flagix allows you to manage separate flag configurations across multiple environments. This guide explains how environments work.

## Understanding Environments

Environments are separate instances of your feature flag configuration. Common environments include:

- **Development**: Local development and team testing
- **Staging**: Production-like environment for QA and acceptance testing
- **Production**: Live environment serving real users

Each environment has:
- Independent flag enable/disable settings
- Separate targeting rules
- Isolated analytics
- Own traffic flow

## Environment Isolation

Flags and variations are shared across environments, but **everything else is isolated**:

| Aspect | Shared | Isolated |
|--------|--------|----------|
| **Variations** | ✅ Yes | - |
| **Flag Key** | ✅ Yes | - |
| **Flag Name** | ✅ Yes | - |
| **Enabled Status** | - | ✅ Per environment |
| **Default Variation** | - | ✅ Per environment |
| **Targeting Rules** | - | ✅ Per environment |
| **Rule Order** | - | ✅ Per environment |
| **Rollout Percentages** | - | ✅ Per environment |
| **Analytics Data** | - | ✅ Per environment |

## Managing Environment-Specific Rules

### Environment Selector

In the flag detail page, use the environment dropdown to switch between environments:

```
[Development ▼] | [Staging ▼] | [Production ▼]
```

Each environment shows its own configuration.

### Creating Environment-Specific Rules

Rules are managed per environment:

1. Select the environment from the dropdown
2. Scroll to **Targeting Rules**
3. Add or edit rules
4. Rules only affect the selected environment

### Copying Rules Between Environments

To replicate rules from staging to production:

1. Open Staging environment
2. Note the rule configuration
3. Switch to Production environment
4. Manually recreate the same rule structure
5. Adjust percentages as needed

## SDK Integration Across Environments

### Detecting Current Environment

Your application should know which environment it's running in:
(Ensure you use the correct api key for the environment you're in)

```javascript
// Determine environment
const env = process.env.NODE_ENV; // "development", "staging", "production"

// Initialize Flagix with environment-specific API key
await Flagix.initialize({
  apiKey: process.env[`FLAGIX_API_KEY_${env.toUpperCase()}`],
  initialContext: {
    userId: user.id,
    environment: env
  }
});
```
